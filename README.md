# LighterPack

LighterPack helps you track the gear you bring on adventures.

LighterPack at its [original repo](https://github.com/galenmaly/lighterpack)
seems dead. So, I (fsf) forked it and updated it as far as I was able. I am
technically competent, but I don't much enjoy working with web development,
although I have done so professionally. I am generally happy to run a modern
instance of LighterPack, but do not plan to take an active leadership role in
feature development.

## Development

1. Install node.js, npm and mongo
2. ```$ git clone https://github.com/ffleming/lighterpack.git```
3. Install dependancies ```$ npm install```
4. start mongo ```$ mongod```
5. Start app ```$ npm start```
6. go to http://localhost:8080

## Priorities

1. Upgrade to Vue3
1. Proper mobile support
1. General feature development
1. Migrate to postgres

But really, that's just what I want to see. If you want something in
LighterPack, send a PR.
