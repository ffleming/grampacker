# Gram Packer

Gram Packer helps you track the gear you bring on adventures.

Gram Packer is a fork of [LighterPack](https://github.com/galenmaly/lighterpack)
LighterPack seems dead. So, I (fsf) forked it and updated it as far as I was
able. I am technically competent, but I don't much enjoy working with web
development, although I have done so professionally. I am generally happy to run
a modern and maintained fork, but do not plan to take an active role in feature
development.

## Development

1. Install node.js, npm and mongo
2. ```$ git clone https://github.com/ffleming/grampacker.git```
3. Install dependancies ```$ npm install```
4. start mongo ```$ mongod```
5. Start app ```$ npm start```
6. go to http://localhost:8080

## Priorities

1. Fix password reset flow
1. Proper mobile support
1. General feature development

But really, that's just what I want to see. If you want something in
Gram Packer, send a PR.
